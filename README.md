**2 Ideas for New Exa Technical Documentation**

## Documentation Idea 1: How to Get Started With Python, pip, VScode and .env files

I’ve spoken with many friends, who do everything from paralegal work to financial analysis, who would like to go beyond what interactive AI models such as Perplexity and ChatGPT offer.  From these conversations, I’ve learned that simply setting up a programming environment is a major barrier to entry. The process of downloading Python, installing pip, and configuring an IDE and project workspace is often assumed knowledge in technical documentation for most leading AI tools. 

For non-developers interested in using these APIs, finding the necessary setup information often means visiting multiple sites just to learn how to download Python and install pip. This extra effort discourages the broader adoption of API use and explains why the extent of most AI use is ChatGPT. If API documentation included straightforward guidance to get new users set up with Python, VS Code, and pip, it could significantly boost engagement from non-developers.  That is why I propose that Exa and all AI companies provide technical documentation for getting users started as programmers.

In addition, most users learn well from examples. Having a greater number of simple code snippets, which users can cut, paste, build, and learn from, will enable users to effectively leverage the APIs of AI companies like Exa. 

## Documentation Idea 2: How to Use Exa and Claude to Create a Legal Assistant Tool

Exa is a powerful tool on its own. However, it is clear from the provided demos and tutorials that it is even more powerful when combined with an LLM. Anthropic’s technical documentation highlights legal analysis as a key use case for their Claude model. Thus, it is fitting for Exa to create a companion tutorial that demonstrates how its API can add even more value to this use case. To make this tutorial useful for the intended end users, it is important to also include how to read a PDF file with Python.

Legal consultants and paralegals I spoke with shared numerous experiences of sifting through lengthy legal filings simply to identify what topics to research for background on a case. These case filings are often found as PDFs on courthouse websites, or in some cases, they are physical documents that get scanned and uploaded as PDFs. By integrating Exa with LLM capabilities and providing clear guidance on PDF processing, Exa can empower legal professionals to streamline their research process, enabling them to focus on meaningful analysis rather than time-consuming document review. I have written the documentation for this tutorial; it can be found here.
