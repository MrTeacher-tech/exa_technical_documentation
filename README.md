## Documentation: How to Use Exa and Claude to Create a Legal Assistant Tool
_see legal_assistant.md to view the documentation I created for this idea_

Exa is a powerful tool on its own. However, it is clear from the provided demos and tutorials that it is even more powerful when combined with an LLM. Anthropicâ€™s technical documentation highlights legal analysis as a key use case for their Claude model. Thus, it is fitting for Exa to create a companion tutorial that demonstrates how its API can add even more value to this use case. To make this tutorial useful for the intended end users, it is important to also include how to read a PDF file with Python.

Legal consultants and paralegals I spoke with shared numerous experiences of sifting through lengthy legal filings simply to identify what topics to research for background on a case. These case filings are often found as PDFs on courthouse websites, or in some cases, they are physical documents that get scanned and uploaded as PDFs. By integrating Exa with LLM capabilities and providing clear guidance on PDF processing, Exa can empower legal professionals to streamline their research process, enabling them to focus on meaningful analysis rather than time-consuming document review. I have written the documentation for this tutorial; it can be found here.
